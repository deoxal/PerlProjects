_\* I define a 'program' as not just being some 'quick and dirty' script I knock out then forget about. To me, a 'program' is something I truely care about presenting to people; something I endeavor to be carefully-written and usually maintained, while being mindful of the user's experience. My definition of a program is flexible, but one thing stands out: I give a damn about you and your experience!_

# Bug/Issue Reporting

If you have any issues or bugs, I strongly recommend reporting it here on GitHub, as it's where I spend most of my time, these days. Failing that, since we're not all obsessed with GitHub, send me an E-Mail over at _terminalforlife@yahoo.com_ (rarely checked, if I'm honest). Lastly, I'm _Learn Linux_ over at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/LearnLinux), so feel free to leave a comment over there; I read them _all_.

Be sure to provide as much information as possible, if you're reporting a bug, such as program output, error messages, system information, etc.

Thanks!
