A brief explanation by this user may satisfy your curiosity for now:

"The Linux kernel provides a tweakable setting that controls how often the swap file is used, called swappiness.

A swappiness setting of zero means that the disk will be avoided unless absolutely necessary (you run out of memory), while a swappiness setting of 100 means that programs will be swapped to disk almost instantly.

Ubuntu system comes with a default of 60, meaning that the swap file will be used fairly often if the memory usage is around half of my RAM."

Or, if you prefer, this user goes in further detail:

"The vm.swappiness option is a modifier that changes the balance between swapping out file cache pages in favour of anonymous pages. The file cache is given an arbitrary priority value of 200 from which vm.swappiness modifier is deducted (file_prio=200-vm.swappiness). Anonymous pages, by default, start out with 60 (anon_prio=vm.swappiness). This means that, by default, the priority weights stand moderately in favour of anonymous pages (anon_prio=60, file_prio=200-60=140). The behaviour is defined in mm/vmscan.c in the kernel source tree."

In short, it's debatable whether there's any need to change the swappiness value, but YMMV. It's often concluded that servers are the better use-cases for swappiness 60 (usually the default in Ubuntu distributions), and that 10 is the better setting for typical desktop use. You'll find arguments for and against adjusting this value all over the Internet, so, as always, come to your own conclusion.

The permissions may well be excessive for the given file. Typically, a `$PATH` executable (`/bin`, `/sbin`, etc) should be no higher than `755` (`rwxr-xr-x`) unless more advanced permissions are set, for which, as of 2020-02-04, UbuChk doesn't check.
:6005,3579
If a `$PATH` executable is owned by a standard user or in such a group, chances are it's a mistake and/or security issue, therefore should probably be rectified. These files are usually, but certainly not always, owned by root (`0`) and part of the root group (`0`).

By default, in most Debian- and Ubuntu-based distributions of Linux, when a package is simply removed (even with `[--]autoremove`) global configuration and other associated files remain. This is observed when running `dpkg -l` in a terminal and looking for packages with a status of `rc`.

There may be situations in which you wish to keep the old configurations left by once-removed packages, such as if you plan to eventually re-install the package.

Refer to the man pages apt.conf(5), apt_preferences(5), and apt(8) for further information on setting special configuration keys for APT.

X11Forwarding -- While incredibly useful, it's often recommended to disabled it, due to security concerns.

PasswordAuthentication, PermitEmptyPasswords -- A must-have during setup, and for otherwise gaining access when keys aren't working, but keep in mind that this is nowhere near as safe as using cryptographic keys. Disables "tunneled clear text passwords", as it says in the default `sshd_config`.

There are a number of packages often made readily available in Ubuntu-based distributions which aren't required by most people, this alert simply means you've found one or more of these packages.

To find out about a given package, open up a terminal and run `apt-cache show PKG`, where 'PKG' is the package name about which you which to learn.

The Uncomplicated FireWall, the front-end to `iptables` is disabled (as it usually is by default), but this doesn't necessarily mean that you're now rendered super-vulnerable to every whack-job with a computer and a grudge to bear, but you are probably best to enable it, just in-case.

This poster says it aptly:

"Out of the box, Ubuntu ships with no TCP or UDP ports open, hence the belief that there's no reason to run Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) by default. I agree, though, that having ufw disabled is a strange decision. My reasoning being that inexperienced users are feasibly going to install things like Samba, Apache and such like as they experiment with the system put before them. If they don't understand the implications of this, they will expose themselves to malicious bevaviour on the internet.

Example - I've got my laptop configured with Samba which is fine in my home network protected with WPA2. But if I take my laptop to a Starbucks, I might not think anything of it, but that laptop is now advertising my shares to all and sundry. With a firewall, I can restrict my samba ports to only my home server or peer devices. No need to worry as much now about who might be trying to connect to my laptop. Same goes for VNC, SSH, or a huge number of other useful services my laptop might be running, or trying to connect to.

Ubuntu takes a very on/off approach to certain elements of security, a philosophy I can't agree with. Security might be technically on or off, but by layering elements of security over one another, you end up with a better system. Sure, Ubuntu's security is good enough for a large number of use cases, but not all.

Bottom line, run ufw. Better safe than sorry."
