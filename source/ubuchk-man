.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Perform various system health checks, with a focus on security.
.PP
Provided, is an extensive user configuration file, offering plenty of different settings, including the ability to tweak various checks and the output to the user's needs.
.PP
The core concept of UbuChk, is to allow the user to easily perform a number of useful system tests, without actually requiring root privileges. In some cases, with more locked-down installations of Ubuntu-based distributions of Linux, root access may be required, but that's down to the user.
.PP
UbuChk doesn't aim to do anything like change system settings, delete system files, change kernel parameters, etc. This means that, within reason, anyone can run UbuChk.
.PP
The approach here is to inform the user and recommend or suggest that he or she does something based on what's in-front of them, similar to how system tools like ClamAV and Rootkit Hunter work.
